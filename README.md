JHC_TranscriptomeAnalysis

  This repository is designed for downstream transcriptome data processing and visualization. The upstream data analysis, including quality control, alignment, quantification, and differential expression analysis, was performed using the online analysis platform provided by Biomarker Technologies. The scripts in this repository focus on further data organization and downstream analysis, such as generating volcano plots, heatmaps, and performing functional enrichment analyses (KEGG and GO analysis). These results provide essential visualization and interpretation support for biological research. The code is flexible and can be adapted for other similar transcriptomic studies.
